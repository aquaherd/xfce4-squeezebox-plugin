Squeezebox XFce4 panel plugin.

    This plugin remote controls some media players from your
panel. It is in no way derived from the mpd plugin (although 
inspired) or from the gnome media applet (although similar).

    Its goal is to control virtually all available audio players
as soon as they allow for remote controlling by dbus, pipe or
bonobo. Required minimal functionality would be play/pause, skip/
rewind and fetch track info, album/artist/title at least. Rating,
album art display and toggling the visibility of the main UI 
would be optional.

    Track change notification is made by means of libnotify only if 
libnotify is available during build.

    Embedded album art extraction is under research (for iTunes 
    switchers like me)
