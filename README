------------------------------
Squeezebox XFce4 panel plugin.
------------------------------

    This plugin remote controls some media players from your
panel. It is in no way derived from the mpc plugin (although 
similar) or from the gnome media applet (although inspired).

    Its goal is to control virtually all available audio players
as soon as they allow for remote controlling by dbus, pipe or
whatever. Required minimal functionality would be play/pause, skip/
rewind and fetch track info, album/artist/title at least. Rating,
album art display and toggling the visibility of the main UI 
would be optional.

    Naming conflicts with existing gadgetery are coincidental. I was
listening to a song of the Who when the idea to this plugin came to me.

    Track change notification is made by means of libnotify only if 
libnotify is available during build.

    Media Keys can be grabbed and ungrabbed with the modified mmkeys.c 
glory, as seen here and there. (See also README.xubuntu in this document.)

    Embedded album art extraction is under research (for iTunes switchers 
like me). It also considers [/.](folder|cover|front).jpg in the file's 
folder if the backend supports file names.
    
    Currently available backends:
    - Rhythmbox 0.95 (via DBUS)
    - Music Player Daemon (via libmpd)
    - QuodLibet (via pipe)
    - audacious 1.5.x (via dbus)
    
    Planned backends:
    - lua scripted with lua-dbus bindings
    - mplayer (via -silent -idle switches with own playlist management)
    - Xfmedia, Banshee, Exaile 
    
    Remotely possible backends:
    - SlimServer (as a nod to aforesaid naming issues)
    - Older Rhythmbox (w/o DBUS via lua-bonobo)
    - xmms (don't know how yet)
    - xmms2 (dito)
    - bmpx (dito)

README.xubuntu:
===============
    
    Somehow, gnome and xorg handle the media keys but they disappear 
under xubuntu hardy. Remedy is as follows:

0) Use the correct keyboard layout ;) Or Else:

1) Create a ~/.Xmodmap file with such content:

keycode 160=XF86AudioMute
keycode 162=XF86AudioPlay
keycode 176=XF86AudioRaiseVolume
keycode 174=XF86AudioLowerVolume
keycode 153=XF86AudioNext
keycode 144=XF86AudioPrev
keycode 164=XF86AudioStop 
(This issue seems resolved with Intrepid)
(Your keycodes may vary, try xev.)

2) run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap during xfce startup.

3) Bleeding edge GTK versions
- gtk+-2.8.20 (Etch)
- gtk+ 2.10.x (xfce-4.6)
- gtk+ 2.12.19 (Hardy)
I'm setting the lowest of the above as dependency, but I include
workarounds for the tooltip change in 2.12 as well.

4) Dropping netk for wnck will happen in xfce-4.6, this release already 
   has it. (Upcoming Jaunty)

============
README.etch:
============
Known issues:
- Packaged Audacious does not support DBUS under etch.
- Packaged QuodLibet may lack album art support (missing plugin)
- Packaged Rhythmbox stores album art on a different location.

===============
README.FreeBSD:
===============
1. make on freebsd is older than GNU make. Therefore GNU make is aliased as gmake.
2. MSGFMT does not expand somehow. Must provide during configure.

So, building any goodie on freebsd boils down to:
Code:

$ ./configure MSGFMT=/usr/local/bin/msgfmt GMSGFMT=/usr/local/bin/msgfmt
$ gmake
$ sudo gmake install

=================
README.Packagers:
=================
- neither my french nor my turkish translations are accurate.
- 'weibullguy' from forum.xfce.org reports 'Cross Linux from Scratch' as 
  a distro this plugin is known to build on.
