------------------------------
Squeezebox XFce4 panel plugin.
------------------------------

    This plugin remote controls some media players from your
panel. It is in no way derived from the mpc plugin (although 
simlar) or from the gnome media applet (although inspired).

    Its goal is to control virtually all available audio players
as soon as they allow for remote controlling by dbus, pipe or
whatever. Required minimal functionality would be play/pause, skip/
rewind and fetch track info, album/artist/title at least. Rating,
album art display and toggling the visibility of the main UI 
would be optional.

    Naming conflicts with existing gadgetery are coincidental. I was
listening to a song of the Who when the idea to this plugin came to me.

    Track change notification is made by means of libnotify only if 
libnotify is available during build.

    Media Keys can be grabbed and ungrabbed with the modified mmkeys.c 
glory, as seen here and there. (See also README.xubuntu in this document.)

    Embedded album art extraction is under research (for iTunes 
    switchers like me)
    
    Currently available backends:
    - Rhythmbox 0.95 (via DBUS)
    - Music Player Daemon (via libmpd)
    - QuodLibet (via pipe)
    
    Planned backends:
    - lua scripted with lua-dbus bindings
    - mplayer (via -silent -idle switches with own playlist management)
    - Xfmedia, Banshee, Exaile (as soon as lua-dbus bindings exist)
    
    Remotely possible backends:
    - SlimServer (as a nod to aforesaid naming issues)
    - Older Rhythmbox (w/o DBUS via lua-bonobo)
    - xmms (don't know how yet)
    - xmms2 (dito)
    - bmpx (dito)

README.xubuntu:
===============
    
    Somehow, gnome and xorg handle the media keys but they disappear under xubuntu.
Remedy is as follows:
1) Create a ~/.Xmodmap file with such content:

keycode 160=XF86AudioMute
keycode 162=XF86AudioPlay
keycode 176=XF86AudioRaiseVolume
keycode 174=XF86AudioLowerVolume
keycode 153=XF86AudioNext
keycode 144=XF86AudioPrev
keycode 164=XF86AudioStop 

(Your keycodes may vary, try xev.)

2) run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap during xfce startup.

3) Bleeding edge GTK versions
- gtk+-2.8.20 (Etch)
- gtk+ 2.10.x (xfce-4.6)
- gtk+ 2.12.19 (Hardy)
I'm setting the lowest of the above as dependency, but I include
workarounds for the tooltip change in 2.12 as well.
